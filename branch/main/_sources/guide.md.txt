## Navigating Files and Directories

Introducing and navigating the filesystem in the shell
(covered in [Navigating Files and Directories](filedir.ipynb) section)
can be confusing. You may have both terminal and GUI file explorer
open side by side so learners can see the content and file
structure while they're using terminal to navigate the system.
